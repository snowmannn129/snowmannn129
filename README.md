# **RebelSUITE**  
**A Free, Open-Source Software Suite for Creativity, Development, and Automation**  

## **About RebelSUITE**  

RebelSUITE is a fully open-source collection of powerful tools designed to replace expensive corporate software in areas such as CAD modeling, game development, coding, and automation.  

This project is **not** created by a professional development teamâ€”it's the work of a single individual who, after an injury, started leveraging AI to build software for those who cannot afford the high costs of industry-standard programs.  

My goal is simple: **Break the chains of corporate software pricing** and give people access to professional-grade toolsâ€”completely free.  

## **What's Inside RebelSUITE?**  

RebelSUITE consists of seven main components, each designed to function independently **or** as part of a seamless ecosystem:  

| Program        | Status                   | Purpose  |
|----------------|--------------------------|----------|
| **RebelCAD**   | ðŸ”„ *55% Alpha Complete*   | A feature-rich CAD/3D modeling tool with advanced geometry and assembly features. A free alternative to SolidWorks and Fusion 360. |
| **RebelCALC**  | ðŸ”„ *30% Alpha Complete*   | An advanced computational engine and calculator with offline support, scripting (Lua), and export capabilities. |
| **RebelFLOW**  | ðŸ”„ *45% Alpha Complete*   | A node-based automation and scripting tool for CAD, game dev, and workflow pipelines. |
| **RebelENGINE**| ðŸ”„ *40% Alpha Complete*   | A modern game engine supporting rendering, physics, AI, and animationâ€”without the subscription walls. |
| **RebelCODE**  | ðŸ”„ *35% Alpha Complete*   | A lightweight coding and scripting environment with blueprint editing, debugging, and AI-assisted tools. |
| **RebelDESK**  | ðŸ”„ *75% Alpha Complete*   | A modular, AI-powered IDE for productivity, project management, and live collaboration. |
| **RebelSCRIBE**| ðŸ”„ *25% Alpha Complete*   | A novel/documentation writing tool featuring AI-assisted content generation, layout editing, and structured content management. |

These programs are designed to share **data, file formats, and plugins**, creating a unified ecosystem.
