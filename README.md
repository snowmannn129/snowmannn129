RebelSUITE
A Free, Open-Source Software Suite for Creativity, Development, and Automation

About RebelSUITE
RebelSUITE is a fully open-source collection of powerful tools designed to replace expensive corporate software in areas such as CAD modeling, game development, coding, and automation.

This project is not created by a professional development team—it's the work of a single individual who, after an injury, started leveraging AI to build software for those who cannot afford the high costs of industry-standard programs.

My goal is simple: Break the chains of corporate software pricing and give people access to professional-grade tools—completely free.

What’s Inside RebelSUITE?
RebelSUITE consists of five main components, each designed to function independently or as part of a seamless ecosystem:

Program	Status	Purpose
RebelCAD	🔄 55% Alpha Complete	A feature-rich CAD/3D modeling tool with advanced geometry and assembly features. A free alternative to SolidWorks and Fusion 360.
RebelFLOW	🔄 45% Alpha Complete	A node-based automation and scripting tool for CAD, game dev, and automation workflows.
RebelENGINE	🔄 40% Alpha Complete	A game engine built for rendering, physics, AI, and animation—without costly subscriptions.
RebelCODE	🔄 35% Alpha Complete	A lightweight coding and scripting environment with debugging and AI-assisted coding.
RebelDESK	🔄 75% Alpha Complete	A modular, AI-powered IDE for productivity, project management, and development.
These programs are designed to share data, file formats, and plugins, creating a unified ecosystem.

Why RebelSUITE?
No Subscriptions, No Paywalls – Free forever, because software should be accessible to everyone.
AI-Assisted Development – Built using AI-driven tools, proving that great software can be created outside the corporate bubble.
Designed for Individuals & Small Teams – Whether you're a student, indie developer, or hobbyist, RebelSUITE offers alternatives to expensive tools.
Cross-Integration Ready – The suite is designed to allow seamless workflows between all RebelSUITE programs.
